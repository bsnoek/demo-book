    ¡Bienvenidos! It is my pleasure to welcome you to the exciting world of AP Spanish! This is one of the most exciting and applicable courses that the College Board offers. You will learn how to take your knowledge of Spanish and apply it to real-world situations that a Spanish speaker may encounter in the everyday life. Moreover, we will move away from concepts and aim towards connections. Specifically, we will stop focusing on vocabulary and grammar (however, we will still continue learning these) and begin focusing on over-arching applications of the language.</p><p><br /></p><h1>
